* Put resources at work to create circularities in your city
The Circular Economy Resource management and Marketplace platform will be the main transnational tool for practical implementation of circular economy. 
It will establish transnational cooperation in the fields, where it is needed due to big-scale approach.
The platform will be the One Stop Shop for Circular Economy in the ALPINE SPACE area

The platform is supporting the 5 level of the Waste Hierarchy

‘Prevention’
means measures taken before a substance, material or product has become waste, that reduce: 
(a) the quantity of waste, including through the re-use of products or the extension of the life span of products;
(b) the adverse impacts of the generated waste on the environment and human health;
(c) the content of harmful substances in materials and products.

‘Re-use’ 
means any operation by which products or components that are not waste are used again for the same purpose for which they were conceived.

‘Recycling’
means any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into products, materials or substances whether for the original or other purposes. It includes the reprocessing of organic material but does not include energy recovery and the reprocessing into materials that are to be used as fuels or for backfilling operations.

‘Recovery’ 
means any operation the principal result of which is waste serving a useful purpose by replacing other materials which would otherwise have been used to fulfil a particular function, or waste being prepared to fulfil that function, in the plant or in the wider economy. Annex II sets out a non-exhaustive list of recovery operations.

‘Disposal’ means any operation which is not recovery even where the operation has as a secondary consequence the reclamation of substances or energy. Annex I sets out a non-exhaustive list of disposal operations.
